        <figcaption id="img-caption">Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an
          English
          mathematician, computer scientist,
          logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the
          development of
          theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the
          Turing
          machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.</p>
